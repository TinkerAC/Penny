> Note: The application should work in similar development environments. This information is
> provided as a reference to ensure optimal compatibility.

## Installation

Penny is a full-stack project. For a complete experience, you'll need to set up both the server and
client applications.

The instructions below are for setting up a test environment at your **local network**.

### Cloning the Repository first

```shell
git clone https://www.github.com/TinkerAC/penny.git
```

### Server Setup

#### Building from Source \[Recommended\]

1. Navigate to `server/src/main/resources` directory
2. Modify the configuration blocks for:
    - port
    - database
    - openai
      (At minimum, you need to configure the database settings for your MySQL environment)
3. Create a database named `penny_server` in your specified database. The Exposed ORM will
   automatically create tables on startup.
4. Run the following command in the project root directory:
   ```shell
    ./gradlew :server:shadowJar
   ```
   After completion, find `server-all.jar` in the `server/build/libs/` directory
   5.Run the server:
   ```shell
   java -jar server-all.jar
   ```

#### Using Pre-built Application\[May not be the latest version\]

1. Download the latest server program `penny_server.jar` from the release page.

2. You may need to extract `penny_server.jar` and modify the configuration file (`application.conf`)
   located in the same directory.

3. Follow the same configuration steps as building from source, then repackage the server program
   using:
   ```shell
   jar cvfm penny_server.jar META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -C penny_server/ .
   ```

4. Run the server using:
   ```shell
   java -jar penny_server.jar
   ```
   The server should start and listen for requests on your local network.

Note: While you can deploy the server to a cloud provider, please be aware that the default
configuration is not secure. Modify the configuration file appropriately for production
environments.

### Client Application Setup

#### Building the Application from Source\[Recommended\]

1. getting your running server IP address and port(such as "http://192.168.1.2:8080")
2. Navigate to the `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/app/penny/config/Config.kt` file
3. Modify the `DEFAULT_URL` constant to your server address
